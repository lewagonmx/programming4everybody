## Welcome!

This repository contains all the files you'll see during the webinars of the course Programming for Everybody hosted by [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/mexico). Welcome aboard! üéâ

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

Any tool you see a teacher using during a live session is **free to use** and **optional** to this course. The applications we'll present are used by thousands of successful tech companies around the world (including us!), and we'll utilise them to show you how to work in a real development environment.

If you don‚Äôt have any prior experience, please just follow the session, ask your eventual questions at the end of it, write and share your experience with your classmates on [the Slack workspace](https://le-wagon-para-todos.slack.com). As explained during the program presentation, this course is just an extension of the [Codecademy Ruby track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby), and you are not required to do anything more than following the meetings.

## Usage

Please star the repository, or just bookmark the page in your favourite browser.

Each Ruby file you see in this repository will be filled by a teacher during the corresponding session. In the [`slides`](https://github.com/lewagonmx/programming4everybody/tree/master/slides) folder you can see and download the slides we share during our lessons.

You'll also find a `test` folder in this repository. **Don't edit or delete any file outside this folder**: it's important to always keep your personal experiments in a separate place! üß™

## Setup

**N.B:** This is a free online learning series, and our teachers **won't** be able to help you with your computer configuration. If you are just moving your first steps (you don't know Git, Ruby, what a terminal is, or any of the tools we are using), please just watch the videos and, if you feel confident enough, use a REPL as described below. Want to learn to configure your computer like a pro? **[Do it with us!](#going-further)**

### REPL

You can use a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) to see and interact with the code we share every session.

First, [create an account on Repl.it](https://repl.it/signup). Once logged-in, come back here and click this button üëâ [![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/lewagonmx/programming4everybody)](https://repl.it/@lewagonmx/programming4everybody) to open this repository there, then click `fork` to save a copy in your personal REPLs collection.

![](https://github.com/lewagonmx/programming4everybody/raw/master/images/repl1.png)

Now click on the file `README.md` to open it, and... wait a second, that's me! ü§ñ

You can use the Ruby console on the right to run quick tests, or create more complex files in the `test` folder and execute them from the integrated shell.
If the shell window is not displaying automatically, open it manually or with the ‚åò‚áßS shortcut (see the first picture below), and run your test files from there with `ruby test/name_of_the_file.rb`.

After a session ends, switch to the `Version Control` tab and click `Pull` to get the new files from the lecture.

![](https://github.com/lewagonmx/programming4everybody/raw/master/images/repl4.png)

**N.B:** if the pull command doesn't work, it's probably because you edited some files you shouldn't touch! üõë Check which ones under `Changed files or folders`, and if they don't belong to the `test` folder, make them look exactly as the ones on GitHub, then click `Pull` again. If this doesn't help either, just come back here and follow the instructions again to create a new copy ‚òùÔ∏è

<!-- ### Git and Ruby

**ONLY** if you already have:

- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation) installed (type `ruby --version` in your terminal, it should give you a version >= 2.2)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed (`git --version` should be >= 1.7)
- a [GitHub profile](https://github.com/join)
- some basic knowledge of programming

you can clone this repository on your computer and fetch the new changes after each session.

First, fork (copy) this repository to your profile.

![](https://github.com/lewagonlisbon/programming4everybody/raw/master/images/fork.png)

Then, open your terminal and run the following commands one at a time (always read the comments carefully, they're there for a reason! üëÄ):

```sh
# TODO: change with your GitHub username
GITHUB_USERNAME="your-github-username"

# 1. Create a new folder where to keep your personal projects:
[ ! -d ~/code ] && mkdir ~/code
[ ! -d ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME ] && mkdir ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME
cd ~/code/$GITHUB_USERNAME

# 2. Clone the repository from your GitHub and connect to @lewagonlisbon's one (run JUST ONCE):
git clone https://github.com/$GITHUB_USERNAME/programming4everybody.git
cd programming4everybody
git remote add upstream https://github.com/lewagonlisbon/programming4everybody.git
git fetch --all
git reset --hard upstream/master

# 3. Open the repository in your favourite editor:
atom . # or `open -a Atom .`
subl . # or `open -a "Sublime Text" .`
code . # or `open -a "Visual Studio Code" .`
```

Check our code from the webinars in your editor and play around in the `test` folder. You can run your test files in the terminal with `ruby test/a_test_file.rb`, or type `irb` to open an interactive Ruby console.

After each session, get the latest updates with:

```sh
git fetch --all
git reset --hard upstream/master
```

> **Bonus**: if you use [Atom](https://atom.io), you can install the [Teletype package](https://teletype.atom.io) and interact with our code when you ask for a live help! ü§ì
